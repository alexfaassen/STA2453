def sigma_clip(y, sigma=3.0, consecutive_pts=1):
    """
    Detect flares (or outliers) in array y via a basic sigma-clipping rule.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    y : array-like
        The 1D data (time series) to examine.
    sigma : float
        The threshold (in standard deviations) for clipping. 
        e.g., sigma=3 means |y - mean(y)| > 3 * std(y) are flagged.
    consecutive_pts : int
        Require this many consecutive outliers to label them as a flare.
        For example, consecutive_pts=1 means any single outlier is flagged
        as a flare, whereas consecutive_pts=2 means we need at least two
        consecutive outliers.
    
    Returns
    -------
    flares : ndarray of int (0 or 1)
        A binary array of the same length as y, where 1 indicates
        the data point is flagged as flare/outlier, and 0 indicates normal.
